# starWarsApi
The goal of this project is to improve my skills in fetching data from APIs using the Star Wars API. I will create a page for each category (e.g. people, planets, films, etc.) and enable the user to sort through the data returned by the corresponding endpoint for that category. Each object will be represented as a card, and each card will display relevant data. My aim is to add more complex features using CSS to enhance the user experience.

By the end of this project, my Star Wars API will be fully functional and allow users to view every single piece of data returned by the Star Wars API.
